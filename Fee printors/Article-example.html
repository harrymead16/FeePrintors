    <img src="/images/image.png" alt="Blockchain Technology" class="article__image">
    <div class="article__content">
      <p class="article__text"><strong>Blockchain</strong> technology is widely known for its association with cryptocurrency, but its potential far exceeds that. As blockchain continues to evolve, it's paving the way for a new financial system that promises transparency, security, and decentralization.</p>

      <p class="article__text">The underlying structure of blockchain allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. This not only reduces transaction costs but also speeds up the transfer of assets, whether they be money, data, or even ownership rights.</p>

      <h3 class="article__subheading">Key Benefits of Blockchain in Finance:</h3>
      <ul class="article__list">
        <li class="article__list-item"><strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain provides an unprecedented level of security through encryption and decentralization, making financial transactions more secure than ever before.</li>
        <li class="article__list-item"><strong>Transparency:</strong> Every transaction on the blockchain is recorded on a public ledger, which can be accessed by anyone, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud.</li>
        <li class="article__list-item"><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> By eliminating middlemen and automating processes through smart contracts, blockchain technology significantly reduces the cost of financial transactions.</li>
        <li class="article__list-item"><strong>Global Accessibility:</strong> Blockchain removes barriers to global financial services, making it easier for anyone with an internet connection to access financial tools.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="article__text">This technological revolution is already taking place across industries such as banking, insurance, and supply chain management. From decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to blockchain-based identity systems, the financial world is rapidly adapting to this new digital landscape.</p>

      <p class="article__text">As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it has the potential to reshape how we interact with money, investments, and financial institutions. The future of finance is digital, and blockchain is leading the charge.</p>
